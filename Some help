1t. you'll want a class to style each of those 'buttons' so it'll be more like:

<div id="top-left"><div class="info-button"><i class="fas fa-asterisk"></i></div></div>

.info-button {
    background: #0084ff;
    width: 24px;
    height: 24px;
    border-radius: 25px;
    padding-top: 4px;
}


Each of the outer divs need a position
.container #top-left {
    position: relative;
}

Each of the icons need their own spacing. Play around with them:
#top-left i{
position: absolute;
    top: -113px;
    left: 33%;
    }
    
    Also: turn off the autoplay on that video.  It's runnin even if no one has selected the modal and I about died of surprise
